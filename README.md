## Project Goals
By completing this project, I gained familiarity with:
- The **Kotlin** programming language.
- Using **ConstraintLayout** for screen layouts.
- Handling user interaction and processing input with **EditText**.
- Updating the UI dynamically based on user interaction with **RecyclerView**.
- Managing app logic to track and evaluate guesses.
